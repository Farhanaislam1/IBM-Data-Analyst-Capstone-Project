# IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project
## Exploring Developer Trends Using the Stack Overflow Survey Dataset
# 🧭 Overview
This capstone project is the final milestone of the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate. In this project, I analyzed a subset of the Stack Overflow Developer Survey dataset to uncover key trends in developer demographics, skills, work preferences, and satisfaction levels.

The goal was to gain actionable insights into the evolving software development landscape, including the most in-demand programming languages, platforms, databases, and the rise of AI tools in development workflows.

# 📈 Dataset Summary
## Source: Stack Overflow Developer Survey (Subset, Open Database License)

## Size:

Rows: 65,437 responses

Columns: 114 variables

## Content Includes:

Demographics (Age, Country, Education)

Professional Experience (YearsCoding, Employment, DevType)

Skills (Languages, Frameworks, Databases, Platforms)

Tools & Technologies (AI usage, OS preferences, Remote work)

Satisfaction Metrics (JobSat, Compensation, Purchase Influence)

# 📌 Objectives
Analyze trends in programming languages, tools, and technologies.

Understand developer learning paths, job satisfaction, and career profiles.

Visualize and communicate findings using IBM Cognos Analytics.

Develop a compelling dashboard and final presentation to share insights with stakeholders.
