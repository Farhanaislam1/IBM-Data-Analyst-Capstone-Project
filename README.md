# IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project
# ðŸ§­ Overview
This capstone project marks the culmination of the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate and provides hands-on experience in the full data analysis workflow. From collecting and preparing data to conducting exploratory data analysis and building interactive dashboards using IBM Cognos Analytics, this project simulates a real-world business scenario within a leading international IT consulting organization.

As a Data Analyst, I was responsible for identifying in-demand programming skills through the analysis of job postings, online training platforms, and industry surveys.

# ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings
#ðŸ”¹ Data Preparation
Collected data from APIs, web scraping, and various sources (.csv, .xlsx, databases).

Cleaned datasets by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and normalizing data using Excel and Python.

#ðŸ”¹ Data Exploration
Used Python to understand data distribution, identify outliers, and calculate correlations.

Performed statistical analysis to extract key patterns and trends.

#ðŸ”¹ Data Visualization
Created visualizations to:

Analyze the distribution of programming skills.

Explore relationships between technologies.

Compare demand across different platforms and tools.

#ðŸ”¹ Dashboard Creation
Designed interactive dashboards using IBM Cognos Analytics.

Integrated insights into a PowerPoint presentation for effective communication with stakeholders.
